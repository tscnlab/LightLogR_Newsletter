## LightLogR 0.10.0 High noon is here {#high-noon-release}

The newest release, [**LightLogR 0.10.0 High noon**](https://tscnlab.github.io/LightLogR/news/index.html#lightlogr-0100-high-noon), brings mid-day clarity to your analyses with improvements across the package. Thank you for the continued feedback and energy that made this possible.

```{r}
#| eval: false
install.packages("LightLogR")
library(LightLogR)
```

### Highlights in v0.10.0 High noon

Switch between the tabs to see a selecton of new additions to the package.

::: {.panel-tabset}

### Summaries

#### Summary table with helpful overview and common light exposure metrics

```{r}
#| eval: false
data |> summary_table()
```

![](assets/02/table_summary.png){width="60%" fig-align="center"} 

Access overview and metric functions separately with `summary_overview()` and `summary_metrics()`

### Group selection

#### Quickly select individuals/groups based on number, summary metric, or randomly:

```{r}
#| eval: false
#return the three topmost groups
data |> sample_groups(n=3) 
```

```{r}
#| eval: false
#return a random group
data |> sample_groups(sample="random")
```

```{r}
#| eval: false
#return the group with the highest average melanopic EDI
data |> sample_groups(order.by = mean(MEDI)) 
```

```{r}
#| eval: false
#return all groups with a median MEDI value above 1000
data |> sample_groups(condition = median(MEDI) > 1000) 
```

Combine these arguments to get quick access to exactly the participants and groups you need

### Versioning

#### Support for multiple file format versions

File formats evolve over time. `LightLogR` is now ready when things change, e.g., through a software update. Simply specify the version you need.

```{r}
#| eval: false
import$VEET(file, version = "2.1.7")
```

How do you know which formats are available and how they differ? And which one is the default when you don't specify anything? Look under `supported_versions()`

```{r}
#| eval: false
supported_versions(device = "VEET") 
```

![](assets/02/versioning.png)

### State viz

#### Individual heights for states

Before 0.10.0 High noon, states and photoperiods would always be displayed as panel-filling. In some cases this could be confusing. Now, states can have their `ymin` and `ymax` aesthetic to add the information where you want it specifically, add states and photoperiods at the same time, or even add multiple states with multiple heights.

Switch between the tabs to see the difference.

:::{.panel-tabset}

##### old

```{r}
#| eval: false
data |> 
  Brown_cut() |> 
  gg_days() |> 
  gg_states(state, aes_fill = state)
```

![](assets/02/states_old.png){width=80% fig-align="center"}

##### new

```{r}
#| eval: false
data |> 
  Brown_cut() |> 
  gg_days() |> 
  gg_states(state, aes_fill = state, ymax = 0, alpha = 1)
```

### Circular time

Time of day is circular, but datetimes are not. This regularly leads to problems when calculating with them, because what happens mathematically, e.g., during averaging, is not always what we intend. E.g., consider these datetimes:

![](assets/02/time.png){width=20%}

Depending on what these indicate, we might need a linear or a circular representation of time-of-day. Let's say they indicate bedtimes, some after, and some before midnight. We try both approaches to calculate the average bedtime.
Switch between the tabs to see the difference.

:::{.panel-tabset}

##### linear

```{r}
#| eval: false
data |> 
  Datetime2Time() |> 
  summarize_numeric()
```

![](assets/02/linear_time.png){width=67%}

In linear time, time-of-day is stored as seconds from midnight. Accordingly, the average is around 10 in the morning - which is not sensible in the context of this example. Thus we have to switch to circular time

Note that we converted datetimes to times prior to averaging. If we had averaged datetimes, the date-component would have added another layer of complexity. 

##### circular

```{r}
#| eval: false
data |> 
  Datetime2Time(circular = TRUE) |> 
  summarize_numeric() |> Circular2Time()
```

![](assets/02/circular_time.png)

Circular time is represented as angles on a circular system. When these are averaged, the distance between two points on the circle is relevant, not where the circle starts or ends. Thus, we get a sensible average, which, in this case, is about 3-4 minutes past midnight.

Note that **LightLogR 0.10.0 High noon** uses the [`circular`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=circular) package to implement this functionality.

## Open and reproducible analysis of light exposure and visual experience data {#open-repro-course}

[![](assets/02/LLR_Tutorial_Banner.png)](https://tscnlab.github.io/LightLogR_webinar/)

In October, we started a course series on the [**Open and reproducible analysis of light exposure and visual experience data**](https://tscnlab.github.io/LightLogR_webinar/), covering *beginner* and *advanced* levels. The course is targeted at all researchers that touch base with personal light exposure and visual experience data collected from wearable devices. The goal is to remove friction around common tasks when preparing analyses and combining streams of data through standardized pipelines and reproducible methods. While **LightLogR** sits at the center of this course, it goes beyond the package to explain tidy frameworks, common approaches (and pitfalls) in analysis, and gathers a research community developing and devoliping standards, instead of reinventing the wheel with every project.

The course consists of dynamic (live) and static analysis scripts that cover all the bases. *Live* tutorials run a self‑contained version of R in your browser - no setup required - with only minor functional limitations. *Static* tutorials provide the complete script exactly as you would run it in a local R installation.

![](assets/02/Live.gif)

In the spirit of openness and reproducibility, the course is completely free of charge, does not require a sign-in, and can be done at any time - just visit the [course website](https://tscnlab.github.io/LightLogR_webinar/). If you would like some additional input on the principles, the tutorials, and a walkthrough, you can register for the free webinar installments of the course:

::: {.callout}

[**Register here**](https://tum-conf.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_xGoHi1i_Sz2flC6-qGcLoQ#/registration)

The remaining dates for the 25/26 webinar series are:

-   3 March 2026 8:30 - 10:00 CET (Beginner)
-   3 March 2026 18:00 - 19:30 CET (Beginner)
-   6 May 2026 8:30 - 10:00 CEST (Advanced)
-   6 May 2026 18:00 - 19:30 CEST (Advanced)

Beginner webinars are repeated between the morning and the evening sessions. Advanced webinars cover one use case each. Spreading the webinars to the central european morning and evening means anyone around the world can join without sacrificing (too much) sleep.

Recordings of past webinars are made available on the [course website](https://tscnlab.github.io/LightLogR_webinar/recordings). Participants of the live webinars have the benefit of a live Q&A at the end of each session, get to vote for future content and focus points, and receive a certificate. For a more complete overview, have a look at the [course flyer](https://tscnlab.github.io/LightLogR_webinar/assets/Online_course_series_2025-26.pdf).

##### We are thrilled to see LightLogR empowering research teams worldwide and look forward to sharing more tools, courses, and community news soon. {style="text-align: center;"}

## **Global Light Commons**: Shaping the Future of Light Data {#glee}

Our "big build", the **Global Light Commons** (a [GLEE initiative](https://www.visualdiet.org)) has been busy as we are meeting with light enthusiasts across continents to understand the needs of our community globally.

### Our Vision

Our goal is to build a shared, open infrastructure for light exposure data. We want to ensure this data is:

-   Findable and accessible to all.
-   Usable across different sectors.
-   Reproducible for rigorous science, informed policy, and improved public health.

### Collaborative Insights

We have been privileged to welcome researchers, government representatives, NGOs, and thought leaders to the table. Together, we’ve explored what sustainable data collection looks like, how to ensure a collective legacy, and the best ways to integrate with existing frameworks.

While we are often working toward different specific outcomes, these conversations have unearthed some shared truths felt throughout our community:

-   The constant pressure to "publish or perish."
-   Existing workflows that unfortunately do not prioritize data upload or open publication.

### Join the Conversation

Each conversation grounds us in a shared vision for the future. We believe this infrastructure must be built with the community, not just for it.

We want to hear from you. If you have perspectives or experiences to share, please get in touch via the [GLEE homepage](https://www.visualdiet.org).
