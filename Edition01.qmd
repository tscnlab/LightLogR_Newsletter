{{< include sunrise.qmd >}}

We are excited to bring you *light news* from the team behind **LightLogR**!

Last year, many of you contributed to our community survey - you have been patient with us and we promise it was not for nothing... We have been busy building something big and implementing your feedback into the newest version of [**LightLogR 0.9.2 Sunrise**](https://tscnlab.github.io/LightLogR/).


Let us first express our sincere appreciation to all who contributed either through the survey or feedback in general, your insights and perspective help shape our research and guide our community activities, thank you.

## LightLogR 0.9.2 Sunrise: your priorities implemented

Here are some of the highlights in LightLogR 0.9.2 Sunrise, with even more to be found in the [changelog](https://tscnlab.github.io/LightLogR/news/index.html#lightlogr-091).

:::{.columns}

::: {.column width="47%"}

::: {.callout}
### Photoperiod support
Simply provide the coordinates of your data collection to add information on sunrise, sunset, and the duration of the photoperiod to your analysis:

- [add_photoperiod()](https://tscnlab.github.io/LightLogR/reference/photoperiod.html) adds photoperiod information to your dataset
- [extract_photoperiod()](https://tscnlab.github.io/LightLogR/reference/photoperiod.html) provides a succinct summary for photoperiod on all relevant days contained in a dataset
- [gg_photoperiod()](https://tscnlab.github.io/LightLogR/reference/gg_photoperiod.html) adds shaded areas for nighttimes in plots
:::

::: {.callout}
### Mind the gaps
Five new functions for complete and regular time series resolve frustrations many of you highlighted.

- [gap_table()](https://tscnlab.github.io/LightLogR/reference/gap_table.html) for a clean summary of available and missing data
- [has_gaps()](https://tscnlab.github.io/LightLogR/reference/has_gaps.html), [has_irregulars()](https://tscnlab.github.io/LightLogR/reference/has_irregulars.html), and [extract_gaps()](https://tscnlab.github.io/LightLogR/reference/extract_gaps.html) for quick assessments
- [remove_partial_data()](https://tscnlab.github.io/LightLogR/reference/remove_partial_data.html) to remove groups with insufficient data
- [gg_gaps()](https://tscnlab.github.io/LightLogR/reference/gg_gaps.html) to visualize where gaps and irregular data occur
:::

::: {.callout}
### Spectral analysis
Three new functions to reconstruct and integrate across light spectra for multi-spectral devices.

- [spectral_reconstruction()](https://tscnlab.github.io/LightLogR/reference/spectral_reconstruction.html) returns spectral irradiances with the help of a calibration matrix
- [spectral_integration()](https://tscnlab.github.io/LightLogR/reference/spectral_integration.html) integrates over the spectrum, either fully or in parts, optionally with action spectra and weighing factors
- [normalize_counts()](https://tscnlab.github.io/LightLogR/reference/normalize_counts.html) normalize raw counts based on sensor outputs and a gain value.
:::

::: {.callout}
### Rock-solid & reproducible
How many stars can you count in this newsletter? Well, ten times as many unit tests, **888** to be specific, ensure that the functions in LightLogR have consistent output, and remain so even with future changes. 

Continuous integration, and three [new tutorials](https://tscnlab.github.io/LightLogR/articles/) ensure analysis with transparent, accessible, and standardized pipelines.

Publication-ready plots that spotlight gaps, states, and 24-h patterns (click to enlarge).

#### Heatmap

```{r}
#| eval: false
data |> gg_heatmap()
```

#### Day/Night

```{r}
#| eval: false

  gg_days() |> 
  gg_photoperiod(coordinates)

#### States

There are many more ways to visualize your data with LightLogR. Visit the [tutorial](https://tscnlab.github.io/LightLogR/articles/Visualizations.html) on visualization to learn more.

### Broader device support
We've added more import wrappers and are now supporting 18 different devices and counting. See the list of supported devices [here](https://tscnlab.github.io/LightLogR/reference/import_Dataset.html#devices). Let us know of any other device that should join the list.
:::

::: {.callout}
### More metrics
We are continuously expanding on the [number of metrics](https://tscnlab.github.io/LightLogR/index.html#metrics-1) we support with a consistent interface and have rewritten the tutorial on [metrics](https://tscnlab.github.io/LightLogR/articles/Metrics.html) because the new functionality of LightLogR makes metric summaries even easier and more flexible.

Notable additions are functions to mark up or extract special conditions from your dataset:

- [add_clusters()](https://tscnlab.github.io/LightLogR/reference/extract_clusters.html) and [extract_clusters()](https://tscnlab.github.io/LightLogR/reference/extract_clusters.html) find clusters of data, where conditions hold for a specified duration.
- [extract_states()](https://tscnlab.github.io/LightLogR/reference/extract_states.html) summarises states in your data
- [summarize_numeric()](https://tscnlab.github.io/LightLogR/reference/summarize_numeric.html)/[summarise_numeric()](https://tscnlab.github.io/LightLogR/reference/summarize_numeric.html) is a quick way to calculate averages across many groups
- [mean_daily()](https://tscnlab.github.io/LightLogR/reference/mean_daily.html) calculates average values for weekdays, weekends, and a weekday/weeken-weighted average

Dealing with many zero values in measurements of light exposure data can also be a challenge for logarithmis transformation. The pair of zero-inflation functions [log_zero_inflated()](https://tscnlab.github.io/LightLogR/reference/log_zero_inflated.html) and [exp_zero_inflated()](https://tscnlab.github.io/LightLogR/reference/exp_zero_inflated.html) help to deal with this issue in a principled way.
